.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCmondo\fR applies variables defined in themefiles
to templates defined in generators. \fB\fCmondo\fR
executes userdefined scripts before any theme is
applied, after each theme is applies and after all
themes are applied. It can also execute a script
after each theme is \fIgenerated\fP\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-\-new\fR|\fB\fC\-n\fR NAME
.br
Creates a new theme named \fBNAME\fP inside
\fBMONDO\_DIR/themes\fP\&.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-apply\fR|\fB\fC\-a\fR THEME
.br
Apply THEME.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-force\fR|\fB\fC\-f\fR
.br
When this flag is set,  the \fB\fC\-\-update\fR and
\fB\fC\-\-generate\fR options will overwrite any existing
files when processing themes.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-generate\fR|\fB\fC\-g\fR all
.br
Generate THEME. If \fB\fC\-f\fR is used, any existing
generated files will get overwritten. If all is
the argument, all themes will get generated.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-update\fR|\fB\fC\-u\fR GENERATOR
.br
Update GENERATOR. This will update all themes,
but only for the given GENERATOR. If \fB\fC\-f\fR is used,
any existing generated files will get overwritten.
If the last argument is the name of an existing
theme, only that theme will get generated.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-list\fR|\fB\fC\-l\fR cursor
.br
Prints a list about the argument to stdout.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-template\fR|\fB\fC\-t\fR FILE
.br
Create a new generator. If the last argument is a
path to an existing file, that file will be used
to create the template (it will copy the file to
\fI\_mondo\-template\fP, and add the path to the target
variable in \fI\_mondo\-settings\fP). If a path is the
only argument, the filename without extension and
leading dot will be used as the name for the
generator.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-call\fR|\fB\fC\-c\fR FUNCTION
.br
Can be used to test the \fBcolor functions\fP,
(\fImix,lighter,darker,more,less\fP) from the
commandline.

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ mondo \-\-call "mix #FFFFFF #000000 0.6"
#666666

.fi
.RE

.PP
If the last argument is the name of an existing
\fBtheme\fP, the variables of that theme will be
available, otherwise the variables of  the last
applied theme is available.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-help\fR|\fB\fC\-h\fR
.br
Show help and exit.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-version\fR|\fB\fC\-v\fR
.br
Show version and exit.

.SH THEMES
.PP
Theme files are located in \fIMONDO\_DIR\fP/themes, to
create a new theme, use the \fB\fC\-n\fR option.

.PP
The first word of each line is the name of a
\fBmondo variable\fP, the rest of the line
(excluding white space between the first and the
second word) will be the value of that variable.
Below i create a simple theme called \fB\fCexample\fR\&.
(the theme name is always it's filename.)

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ cat << EOF > \~/.config/mondo/themes/example
# example theme
author    Nils Kvist
blue #0000FF
fontface Terminus
EOF

.fi
.RE

.PP
*in the example above the theme file is created
directly, it is strongly recommended to use: *
\fB\fCmondo \-n THEME\fR \fIto create a theme\fP\&.

.PP
Lines starting with \fB\fC#\fR, will be ignored. The
example above would result in three variables:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
author="Nils Kvist"
.IP \(bu 2
blue="#0000FF"
.IP \(bu 2
fontface="Terminus"

.RE

.SH GENERATORS
.PP
Generators are located in \fIMONDO\_DIR\fP/generator.
To create a new generator use the \fB\fC\-t\fR option. The
only file that is needed for a generator to work
is \fI\_mondo\-template\fP\&. If a filename was the last
argument when \fB\fCmondo\fR was executed with the \fB\fC\-t\fR
(create generator) option, \fI\_mondo\-template\fP will
be a copy of that file.

.PP
In the template files, one can use the \fBmondo
variables\fP defined in the theme files by typing
the name of the variable enclosed in double (\fB\fC%%\fR)
percentage characters, like this:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ cat << EOF > \\
  \~/.config/mondo/generator/presentation/\_mondo\-template
My name is %%author%%, my favorite color is %%blue%%. 
I like to set my terminal font to:("%%fontface%%").
EOF

.fi
.RE

.PP
To process this template one can either use: \fB\fC$
mondo \-g THEME\fR this will \fIgenerate\fP (process),
all \fI\_mondo\-template\fP files in each \fBgenerator\fP\&.
\fB\fC$ mondo \-a THEME\fR will do the same thing AND
apply the generated files. We could also use: \fB\fC$
mondo \-u GENERATOR\fR this will generate all themes
for a specific GENERATOR.

.PP
Lets say that our \fIMONDO\_DIR\fP looks like this:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\~/.config/mondo
  generator/
    presentation/
      \_mondo\-template (presentation file)
      \_mondo\-settings
      \_mondo\-generate
      \_mondo\-apply
  themes/
    \_default
    example
  post\-apply
  pre\-apply

.fi
.RE

.PP
If we where to execute the generate command on
the example theme:

.PP
\fB\fC$ mondo \-g example\fR

.PP
A file name example would get generated in
presentation directory after that the script
\fI\_mondo\-generate\fP would get executed (the scripts
are empty by default).

.PP
.RS

.nf
\~/.config/mondo
  generator/
    presentation/
      \_mondo\-template (presentation file)
      \_mondo\-settings
      \_mondo\-generate
      \_mondo\-apply
      example (generated file)
  themes/
    \_default
    example (theme file)
  post\-apply
  pre\-apply

.fi
.RE

.PP
\fB\fC\~/.config/mondo/generator/example\fR:

.PP
.RS

.nf
My name is Nils Kvist, my favorite color is #0000FF. 
I like to set my terminal font to:("Terminus").

.fi
.RE

.PP
If we now would execute \fB\fCmondo\fR with the apply
\fB\fC\-a\fR option on the \fB\fCexample\fR theme, the following
would happen:

.PP
\fB\fC$ mondo \-a example\fR

.RS
.IP "  1." 5
the \fIpre\-apply\fP script would get executed

.RE

.PP
(empty by default)
.br
2. if the theme is not generated, it would be generated

.PP
following the same procedure as above, for each
generator.
.br
3. If the variable \fB\fCtarget\fR is set in *\_mondo\-settings,

.PP
the generated file
(\fIgenerator/presentation/example\fP),    would be
copied to the location specified as \fB\fCtarget\fR
.br
4. \fIgenerator/presentation/\_mondo\-apply\fP would get executed.

.PP
(\fIempty by default\fP)
.br
5. A file called \fB\fCMONDO\_DIR/themes/.current\fR is generated

.PP
it contains all variables and is used when \fB\fCmondo
\-l var|get\fR    is executed.
.br
6. \fIpost\-apply\fP would get executed

.PP
Most of the autogenerated files have useful
comments.

.PP
.RS

.nf

.RE

.PP
It is really easy to create custom templates and
actions (scripts) that will use the theme files.

.PP
An example of how the theme above could be:
.br
* apply values to polybar, i3, xresources
* execute a script in which polybar, i3, and xrdb is reloaded

.PP
See the [wiki] for a more details on how to use
\fBmondo\fP\&.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\fB\fCMONDO\_DIR\fR
.br
The path to a directory where all mondo files
are. defaults to: $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/mondo
