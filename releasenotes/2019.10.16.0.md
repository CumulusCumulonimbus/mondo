### 2019.01.16.0

Major refactoring to make use of the [bashbud] framework.  
[bashbud]: https://github.com/budlabs/bashbud

#### color functions

Added some color manipulation functions that can be used both in themes and templates and the commandline:

**MONDO_DIR/themes/muh-theme**  
```text
bg          #FFFFFF
fg          #000000
red         #FF0000

comment     %%mix bg fg 0.6%%
darkred     %%darker red 0.465%%
bg2         %%less bg 0.33%%
green       %%more #00FF00 0.3%%
```

**less** and **more** works like this:  
First **mondo** determines whether target color is *dark* or *light*.
If the color is *light* and the command is **more**, 
the result will be **more light** 
(same results as if the command was **lighter**).
If the color is *dark* and the command is **more**, 
the result will be **more dark** 
(same results as if the command was **darker**).

It is also possible to use the functions on the commandline:  
`mondo --call|-c FUNCTION [THEME]`  

```text
$ mondo --call "mix #FFFFFF #000000 0.6"
#666666
```

If the last argument is the name of an existing **theme**,
the variables of that theme will be available:  

```text
$ mondo --call "mix #FFFFFF darkred 0.123" muh-theme
#F0DFDF
```


#### colorformat

A new setting is now available in **template-setting** files: `colorformat`.
If set, all expanded variables in affected template will have that format.

**MONDO_DIR/generator/muh-generator/_mondo-settings**  
```text
# uncomment the colorformat below to use HEX (00-FF)
# This is how fully opaque "white" would look like
# with this format: #FFFFFFFF
# colorformat="#%R%G%B%A"

# uncomment the colorformat below to use RGB (0-255)
# This is how fully opaque "white" would look like
# with this format: 255,255,255,255
# colorformat="%r,%g,%b,%a"
```

#### fixes

Various small bugfixes, f.i. to use the `Inject` template setting, it's value
must be either `True` or `true` .  

When using the `--list` command, variables with values containing whitespace, now gets printed properly.
